# The Problem
While easy for some, finding new music that fits one taste is a constant challenge.  This is not only proven by our two interviewee subjects, but by the fact so many recourses and solutions have aimed to help people complete this task over the last decade.  Products such as Gnoosic, IfYouDig and Shazam lead the charge to helping users find new music, but the one the one that won over the market the hardest is Spotify and its great algorithm.  Despite this, through our interviews, we found that many people find it a chore to have to constantly search for songs to listen to while they are travelling to a destination, since spotify or related music apps do not auto generate a playlist of songs for users.  

## Interviews
**Focus**: How do you find new music and create playlists and what do you do when you travel?

### What is your name/age/occupation?
* **Alvin**: Alvin Luc, 21, Student

* **Karin**: Karin, 18, Student

### What does music mean to you?

* **Alvin**: Uhhhmm, I broke my phone early in the quarter and could not listen to music for a week and I realized how much I need it and love it.  It means a lot to me especially in the more recent years since I am walking around a lot for school and waiting for classes to start.  Also, I have found a lot of music I like in the more recent years compared to high school where I did not listen to music at all.

* **Karin**: I love music, especially because I love to dance, so I guess it means a lot.

### Do you spend a lot of time listening to new music?
* **Alvin**: I spend a lot of time listening to music.  I am pretty much listening to music all day between my phone when I am hour and my computer when I am home.

* **Karin**: Just when I am in the car, doing homework or showering.

### What resources do you use to listen to music?
* **Alvin**: I use two, Spotify for everything thatâ€™s on Spotify, and you already know this but I listen to a lot of anime music as well which is not on Spotify so I also use the Japanese music app.

* **Karin**: I normally just use Spotify, but I also use YouTube a lot.

### Do you have playlists you use?
* **Alvin**: Not really, I generally just have two huge playlists, one for each app I use.  I just add a new song I like to that one big playlist.

* **Karin**: No, I tried to make a Spotify playlist but I got really lazy to add songs in, so it only has like 50 songs and that does not change often.

### How often do you make a new playlist? If not often, why?
* **Alvin**: I will usually never make a playlist, I just use my one big one.  It seems like a lot of work to sort your music, I understand why people do it, but to me it seems like too much work.

* **Karin**: I never make a new playlist, that is because it is annoying for me to make it and feels like a waste of time.  What I do is just listen to premade playlists or the entire album of something since Spotify has that option.  Other than that I just listen to individual songs I like on YouTube.

### What methods do you have to finding new music?
* **Alvin**: To be honest, I do not listen to that much new music it is usually the same.  The only new music I get is each three months when a new anime season comes out, I get the new openings and endings I like.

* **Karin**: I honestly just listen to the most popular music, so whatever is on the radio and top of the charts.  Other than that, I am a big kpop fan so I listen to new kpop songs whenever a group releases a new MV.  For my favorite groups, I listen to all their new albums.

### Is finding new music treated as a hobby or a chore? Is it time consuming? Do you ever sit down to just find new music?
* **Alvin**: It is definitely time consuming.  Finding music is hard because finding new things requires me to take an hour or so to listen to new songs and search for different artists names.  It can feel like a chore, but it is an hobby to me.

* **Karin**: It feels like a chore to me because it is not something I just do when I am lazy.  It is an effort and I have to force myself too.  I guess that is why I just listen to the popular songs and the radio.

### Do you share similar music interests to the people close to you in life?
* **Alvin**: No, not really, music is not something we normally talk about.  I will say recently, I went to Japan on exchange and one of the classmates I became close with introduced me to an artist I now really like, but it does not happen often.

* **Karin**: I would say I do.  Every listen to the most popular music at the time so when it comes on or someone sings the song it is really easy to talk about or sing along.  I have a lot of online friends too and we are all into kpop.

### Do you listen to anything while traveling, whether it be walking to class or a road trip? Why or Why not?
* **Alvin**: Yes, I listen to music every single time I go somewhere.  It makes the trip more pleasurable and less boring, I actually think going from point A to point B is a waste of time and music makes it feel less wasteful

* **Karin**: Yeah, whenever I am in the car I listen to music.  I do not walk that much but when I do I will have Spotify on.
