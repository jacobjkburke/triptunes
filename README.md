# Description
The app uses the Google Maps API to allow users to input a destination and choose their method of transportation.  The user is able to enter an artist or genre into a “playlist form” that then uses Spotify API to create them a playlist based on the length of time it will take them to travel from point A to point B.  
## For example, 
A user is at home and inputs “University of Washington” as their destination, and walking as their method of transportation.  The app will show the user the most optimal path to the University and display that it will take 14 minutes.  After entering “Kanye West” into the app, a 15 minute and 47 second playlist is formed for the user to listen to on their walk to campus.
